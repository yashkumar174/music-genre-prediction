This project demonstrates a real-time music genre classification system using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). 
It leverages Librosa for audio feature extraction and TensorFlow/Keras for building and training the model.

features:-
1.Real-time audio recording via microphone.

2.Intelligent genre prediction using MFCC, Chroma, Mel-Spectrogram, and ZCR features.

3.CNN-based architecture for high accuracy.

4.Automatic silence detection to avoid false predictions.

5.Configurable dataset and training parameters.
